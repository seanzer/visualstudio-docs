# How to: Add a Project Output Reference
  To deploy non-SharePoint project assemblies (or .xap files in Silverlight projects) to SharePoint, add them as a project output reference.  
  
 This process creates a solution build dependency between the two projects. Projects associated with project output references are built before the SharePoint project is built and deployed.  
  
### To add a Project Output Reference  
  
1.  Load a solution that contains at least one SharePoint project and one non-SharePoint project.  
  
2.  In **Solution Explorer**, choose an item in the SharePoint project node.  
  
3.  In the **Properties** window, choose the **Project Output References** property, and then choose the ellipsis (![ASP.NET Mobile Designer ellipse](../sharepoint/media/mwellipsis.gif "ASP.NET Mobile Designer ellipse")) button next to it.  
  
4.  In the **Project Output References** dialog box, choose the **Add** button.  
  
5.  In the properties pane, choose the arrow next to the **Deployment Type** property, and then choose an appropriate value for the non-SharePoint item you are referencing, such as **ElementFile**.  
  
6.  Choose the arrow next to **Project Name**, choose the name of the non-SharePoint project item, and then choose the **OK** button.
