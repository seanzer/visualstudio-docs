# How to: Add a Parameter to a Method
  Use a parameter to pass information into the method or to return information from a method. All methods must have at least one parameter. For more information about how to design a parameter to support the type of method that you want to create, see [Designing a Business Data Connectivity Model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).  
  
 When you add a parameter to a method, Visual Studio adds the `<Parameter>` element to the XML of the model file in your project. For more information about the attributes of a `<Parameter>` element, see [Parameter](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=169284).  
  
### To add a parameter to a method  
  
1.  Add a method to an entity.  
  
2.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Other Windows**, **BDC Method Details**.  
  
     The **BDC Method Details** window opens. For more information, see [BDC Model Design Tools Overview](../sharepoint/bdc-model-design-tools-overview.md).  
  
3.  In the **BDC Method Details** window, expand the node of the method, and then expand the **Parameters** node.  
  
4.  In the **Add a Parameter** list, choose **Create Parameter**.  
  
     A new parameter appears beneath the **Parameters** node.  
  
5.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Properties Window**.  
  
6.  In the **Properties** window, set the **Name** property to any name that makes sense. For example, if the method will return customers, you might name the method **GetCustomers**.  
  
7.  In the **BDC Method Details** window, open the list that appears for the direction of the parameter, and then choose **In**, **InOut**, **Out**, or **Return**.  
  
     For more information about which direction to choose for the type method that you are creating, see [Designing a Business Data Connectivity Model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).  
  
8.  Modify the type descriptor of the parameter. For more information, see [How to: Define the Type Descriptor of a Parameter](../sharepoint/how-to-define-the-type-descriptor-of-a-parameter.md).
