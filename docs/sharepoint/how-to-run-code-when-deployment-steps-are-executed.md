# How to: Run Code When Deployment Steps are Executed
  If you want to perform additional tasks for a deployment step in a SharePoint project, you can handle events that are raised by SharePoint project items before and after Visual Studio executes each deployment step. For more information, see [Extending SharePoint Packaging and Deployment](../sharepoint/extending-sharepoint-packaging-and-deployment.md).  
  
### To run code when deployment steps are executed  
  
1.  Create a project item extension, a project extension, or a definition of a new project item type. For more information, see the following topics:  
  
    -   [How to: Create a SharePoint Project Item Extension](../sharepoint/how-to-create-a-sharepoint-project-item-extension.md)  
  
    -   [How to: Create a SharePoint Project Extension](../sharepoint/how-to-create-a-sharepoint-project-extension.md)  
  
    -   [How to: Define a SharePoint Project Item Type](../sharepoint/how-to-define-a-sharepoint-project-item-type.md)  
  
2.  In the extension, handle the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemEvents.DeploymentStepStarted> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemEvents.DeploymentStepCompleted> events of an <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemType> object (in a project item extension or project extension) or an <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemTypeDefinition> object (in a definition of a new project item type).  
  
3.  In the event handlers, use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.DeploymentStepStartedEventArgs> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.DeploymentStepCompletedEventArgs> parameters to get information about the deployment step. For example, you can determine which deployment step is executing and whether the solution is being deployed or retracted.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to handle the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemEvents.DeploymentStepStarted> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemEvents.DeploymentStepCompleted> events in an extension for the List Instance project item. This extension writes an additional message to the **Output** window when Visual Studio recycles the application pool while deploying and retracting the solution.  
  
 [!code-vb[SPExtensibility.ProjectSystemExtension.General#4](../sharepoint/codesnippet/VisualBasic/projectsystemexamples/extension/handledeploymentstepevents.vb#4)]
 [!code-csharp[SPExtensibility.ProjectSystemExtension.General#4](../sharepoint/codesnippet/CSharp/projectsystemexamples/extension/handledeploymentstepevents.cs#4)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires references to the following assemblies:  
  
-   Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint  
  
-   System.ComponentModel.Composition  
  
## Deploying the Extension  
 To deploy the extension, create a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] extension (VSIX) package for the assembly and any other files that you want to distribute with the extension. For more information, see [Deploying Extensions for the SharePoint Tools in Visual Studio](../sharepoint/deploying-extensions-for-the-sharepoint-tools-in-visual-studio.md).
