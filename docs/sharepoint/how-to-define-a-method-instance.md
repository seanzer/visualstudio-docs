# How to: Define a Method Instance
  You must define at least one method instance for every method in your model.  
  
 Add a method instance by using the **BDC Method Details** window. When you add the method instance, Visual Studio adds a `<MethodInstance>` element to the XML of the model file in your project. For more information about the attributes of a `<MethodInstance>` element, see [MethodInstance](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=169282).  
  
### To define a method instance  
  
1.  In the **BDC Method Details** window, expand the node of a method, and then expand the **Instances** node.  
  
2.  In the **Add a Method Instance** list, choose **Create Finder Instance**.  
  
     A new method instance appears beneath the **Instances** node.  
  
3.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, choose **Properties Window**.  
  
4.  In the **Properties** window, set the properties of the method instance. For more information about each property, see [MethodInstance](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=169282).
