# How to: Add a Finder Method
  To enable the Business Data Connectivity service to display a list of entities in a web part or list, you must create a *Finder* method. A Finder method is a special method that returns a collection of entity instances. For more information, see [Designing a Business Data Connectivity Model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).  
  
### To create a Finder method  
  
1.  On the BDC designer, choose an entity.  
  
     For more information, see [How to: Add an Entity to a Model](../sharepoint/how-to-add-an-entity-to-a-model.md).  
  
2.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Other Windows**, **BDC Method Details**.  
  
     The **BDC Method Details** window opens. For more information about the **BDC Method Details** window, see [BDC Model Design Tools Overview](../sharepoint/bdc-model-design-tools-overview.md).  
  
3.  In the **Add a Method** list, choose **Create Finder Method**.  
  
     Visual Studio adds a method, a return parameter, and a type descriptor.  
  
4.  Configure the type descriptor as an entity collection type descriptor. For more information about how to create an entity collection type descriptor, see [How to: Define the Type Descriptor of a Parameter](../sharepoint/how-to-define-the-type-descriptor-of-a-parameter.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You do not have to perform this step if you have added a Specific Finder method to the entity. Visual Studio uses the type descriptor that you defined in the Specific Finder method.  
  
5.  In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu of the service code file that was generated for the entity, and then choose **View Code**. For more information about the service code file, see [Creating a Business Data Connectivity Model](../sharepoint/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).  
  
6.  Add code to the Finder method. This code performs the following tasks:  
  
    -   Retrieves data from a data source.  
  
    -   Returns a list of entities to the BDC service.  
  
     The following example returns a collection of `Contact` entities by using data from the AdventureWorks sample database for SQL Server.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Replace the value of the `ServerName` field with the name of your server.
