# How to: Edit a SharePoint Deployment Configuration
  You can create a deployment configuration or modify an existing deployment configuration. For example, you could run a single step or change the order of the steps in the deployment process. You may want to create or modify deployment configurations because the built-in and programmatically added configurations cannot be changed.  
  
## Creating a SharePoint Deployment Configuration  
  
#### To create a SharePoint deployment configuration  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, choose a SharePoint project, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Project**, *ProjectName***Properties**.  
  
2.  On the **SharePoint** tab, choose the **New** button.  
  
     The **Add New Deployment Configuration** dialog box appears.  
  
3.  In the **Name** text box, enter a name for the deployment configuration.  
  
4.  In the **Available Deployment Steps** pane, choose the steps that you want to add to the deployment configuration, choose the (**>**) button, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have configured a pre-deployment command or a post-deployment command, these steps run only if you add them to a customized deployment configuration.  
  
## Changing the Active Deployment Configuration  
  
#### To change the active deployment configuration  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, choose a SharePoint project, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Project**, *ProjectName***Properties**.  
  
2.  Choose the **SharePoint** tab.  
  
3.  In the **Active Deployment Configuration** list box, choose the name of the deployment configuration that you want to use.
