# How to: Add an Updater Method
  You can enable users to update business data in a SharePoint external list by creating an *Updater* method. For more information, see [Designing a Business Data Connectivity Model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).  
  
### To create an Updater method  
  
1.  On the BDC designer, choose an entity.  
  
2.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Other Windows**, **BDC Method Details**.  
  
     The BDC Method Details window opens. For more information about this window, see [BDC Model Design Tools Overview](../sharepoint/bdc-model-design-tools-overview.md).  
  
3.  In the **Add a Method** list, choose **Create Updater Method**.  
  
     Visual Studio adds the following elements to the model. These elements appear in the BDC Method Details window.  
  
    -   A method that's named **Update**.  
  
    -   An input parameter for the method.  
  
    -   A type descriptor for the parameter. By default, Visual Studio uses the entity type descriptor that you defined for the Finder method (for example: Contact).  
  
    -   A method instance for the method.  
  
     For more information, see [Designing a Business Data Connectivity Model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the identifier of the entity type represents a field in a database table that's not automatically generated, set the **Pre-Updater Field** property to **True**.  
  
4.  In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu of the service code file that was generated for the entity, and then choose **View Code**.  
  
     The entity service code file opens in the Code Editor. For more information about that file, see [Creating a Business Data Connectivity Model](../sharepoint/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).  
  
5.  Add code to the Update method to update data. The following example updates information for a contact in the AdventureWorks sample database for SQL Server.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Replace the value of the `ServerName` field with the name of your server.
