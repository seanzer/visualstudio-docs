# How to: Add a Shortcut Menu Item to SharePoint Projects
  You can add a shortcut menu item to any SharePoint project. The menu item appears when a user right-clicks a project node in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
 The following steps assume that you have already created a project extension. For more information, see [How to: Create a SharePoint Project Extension](../sharepoint/how-to-create-a-sharepoint-project-extension.md).  
  
### To add a shortcut menu item to SharePoint projects  
  
1.  In the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectExtension.Initialize%2A> method of your <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectExtension> implementation, handle the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectEvents.ProjectMenuItemsRequested> event of the *projectService* parameter.  
  
2.  In your event handler for the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectEvents.ProjectMenuItemsRequested> event, add a new <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.IMenuItem> object to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.SharePointProjectMenuItemsRequestedEventArgs.ActionMenuItems%2A> or <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.SharePointProjectMenuItemsRequestedEventArgs.AddMenuItems%2A> collection of the event arguments parameter.  
  
3.  In the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.IMenuItem.Click> event handler for the new <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.IMenuItem> object, perform the tasks you want to execute when a user clicks your shortcut menu item.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to add a shortcut menu item to SharePoint project nodes in **Solution Explorer**. When the user right-clicks a project node and clicks the **Write Message to Output Window** menu item, Visual Studio displays a message in the **Output** window. This example uses the SharePoint project service to display the message. For more information, see [Using the SharePoint Project Service](../sharepoint/using-the-sharepoint-project-service.md).  
  
 [!code-csharp[SPExtensibility.ProjectExtension.Menu#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/CSharp/projectmenu/extension/projectitemextensionmenu.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[SPExtensibility.ProjectExtension.Menu#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/VisualBasic/projectmenu/extension/projectitemextensionmenu.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires a class library project with references to the following assemblies:  
  
-   Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint  
  
-   System.ComponentModel.Composition  
  
## Deploying the Extension  
 To deploy the extension, create a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] extension (VSIX) package for the assembly and any other files that you want to distribute with the extension. For more information, see [Deploying Extensions for the SharePoint Tools in Visual Studio](../sharepoint/deploying-extensions-for-the-sharepoint-tools-in-visual-studio.md).
