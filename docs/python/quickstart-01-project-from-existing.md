# Quickstart: create a Python project from existing code

Once you've [installed Python support in Visual Studio 2017](installation.md), it's easy to bring existing Python code into a Visual Studio project. 

> [!Important]
> The process described here does not move or copy the original source files. If you want to work with a copy, duplicate the folder first.

[!INCLUDE[project-from-existing](includes/project-from-existing.md)]

8. If desired, run the program by pressing Ctrl+F5 or selecting **Debug > Start Without Debugging**.
