# Remote Debugging Troubleshooter for Python and Azure

Visual Studio fails to attach to an [Azure App Service for remote debugging](debugging-azure-remote.md) for any of the following reasons:

| Reason | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| You do not have Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 or later installed. | Install a suitable version from [visualstudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). | 
| The project that's deployed to App Service doesn't match the one open in Visual Studio. | Load the correct project into Visual Studio. |
| The project wasn't deployed with the Debug configuration. | Redeploy the application by right-clicking the project in Solution Explorer and selecting **Publish**. In the **Settings** tab, make sure **Debug** is the selected configuration. |
| The App Service isn't running. | Start it from Server Explorer in Visual Studio or from the Azure portal. |
| The App Service isn't configured for web sockets. | Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your App Service, open the  **Settings > Application settings** blade, turn **General settings > Web sockets** to **On**, and select **Save**. (Note that the **Debugging** options shown on this blade do *not* apply to Python debugging.) |
| `web.debug.config` was modified to disable the debug proxy. | Delete the file and republish the project to App Service, during which time Visual Studio recreates the file. |
