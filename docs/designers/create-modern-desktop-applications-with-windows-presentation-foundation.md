# Create Modern Desktop Applications with Windows Presentation Foundation

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) in Visual Studio provides developers with a unified programming model for building modern line-of-business desktop applications on Windows.  

For in-depth walkthroughs, begin with [Getting Started with WPF](../designers/getting-started-with-wpf.md) and follow through its secondary topics.

For a comparison of available tools, see [Designing XAML in Visual Studio and Blend for Visual Studio](../designers/designing-xaml-in-visual-studio.md).
