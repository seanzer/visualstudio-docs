# How to: Find the Name of the ASP.NET Process
To attach to a running [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] application, you have to know the name of the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] process:  

-   If you are running ASP.NET Core on IIS or IISExpress, the process name is dotnet.exe.

-   If you are running ASP.NET on IIS 6.0 later, the name is w3wp.exe.  
  
-   If you are running ASP.NET on an earlier version of IIS, the name is aspnet_wp.exe.

-   If you are running ASP.NET on IISExpress, the name is iisexpress.exe.
  
For applications built by using versions of Visual Studio prior to Visual Studio 2012, the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] code can reside on the file system and run under the test server WebDev.WebServer.exe or WebDev.WebServer40.exe. In that case, you must attach to WebDev.WebServer.exe or WebDev.WebServer40.exe instead of the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] process. This scenario applies only to local debugging.
  
Older ASP applications run inside the IIS process inetinfo.exe when they are running in-process.  

### To determine the IIS version under which the application is running  

1.  Make sure the application is running and then, from Visual Studio, use the [Attach to Process](../debugger/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger.md) command.

2.  Type the first letter of a process name like w3wp.exe to quickly find processes in the **Available Processes** list.

    The available processes from the list in this topic will indicate which versions of IIS are available, and which process is running your application.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Starting in Visual Studio 2017, you can use the search box to search for the process name.
