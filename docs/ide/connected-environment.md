# Connected environment
Visual Studio is a connected environment:  

- You can sign in to Visual Studio to enable access to all the services associated with your user account, as well as all the accounts that are linked to that account. Your account settings roam with you wherever you use Visual Studio.  
- Visual Studio informs you when any component of your installation, such as an SDK, had an update available.  
- You can download NuGet packages and extensions.  
- And more...
