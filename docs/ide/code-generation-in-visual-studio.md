# Code Generation in Visual Studio
Visual Studio can help generate portions of source code for you, letting you focus on the real work.  Some common code generation features include:  

* Generating classes, methods, types, etc.
* Generating XML Documentation Comments
* Implementing abstract classes or interfaces
* Introducing a local variable into a complex expression

Because the logic of code generation is closely tied to language syntax, each language service in Visual Studio provides its own code generation capabilities. For more information, see the following pages:  
  
* [Code Generation (C#)](../csharp-ide/code-generation-csharp.md)
* [Code Generation (Visual Basic)](../vb-ide/code-generation-vb.md)

Documentation for other languages coming soon...
