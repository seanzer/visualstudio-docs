# Personalize the Visual Studio IDE

You can personalize Visual Studio in various ways to best support your own development style and requirements. This topic briefly describes different personalizations and where to find more information.

 Additional options are also exposed through the [Environment Options Dialog Box](../ide/reference/environment-options-dialog-box.md). Furthermore, many of your settings roam with you across Visual Studio instances. See [Synchronized Settings](../ide/synchronized-settings-in-visual-studio.md).

## Window layouts

You can define and save multiple window layouts and switch between them. For example, you can define a layout for coding and one for debugging. To arrange window positions and behavior, and save custom layouts, see [Customizing window layouts](../ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio.md).  

## General environment options  

 To customize many environment settings, type `environment` in **QuickLaunch**. When the property page appears, you can press  **F1** for more help on the various settings on that page. See also [Environment Options Dialog Box](../ide/reference/environment-options-dialog-box.md).  

## External tools  
 To customize which external tools appear in menus and toolbars, see [Managing External Tools](../ide/managing-external-tools.md).  

## Start page  
 To create a custom start page for you and your team, see [Customizing the Start Page](../ide/customizing-the-start-page-for-visual-studio.md).

## Environment color themes  
 To change the color theme between light, dark and blue, type "environment" in **QuickLaunch**, choose **Environment > General**, and change the **Color theme** option.

To change colorization options in the editor, type `environment` in **QuickLaunch** and choose **Environment > Fonts and Colors**. See also [How to: Change Fonts and Colors](../ide/how-to-change-fonts-and-colors-in-visual-studio.md).  

### Menus and toolbars  
 To add or remove menu or toolbar items, see [How to: Customize Menus and Toolbars](../ide/how-to-customize-menus-and-toolbars-in-visual-studio.md).  

### Main menu casing  
 You can change the main menu casing between **Title Case** (such as "File") and **ALL CAPS** ("FILE"). Type "environment" in **QuickLaunch**, select **Environment > General**, and change the **Apply title case styling to menu bar** option.
