# Talk to Us
We're interested in your ideas for improving our products and our documentation. We can't always respond personally, but we'll make sure that your feedback gets to the right person or team.  

## I want to report a problem with Visual Studio  
 If you are running into issues using Visual Studio, such as crashes, sluggish performance, unexpected behavior, and so on, please report the problem to us by using the **Report a Problem** tool. Simply click the feedback icon next to **QuickLaunch**, or choose **Help &#124; Send Feedback &#124; Report a Problem** from the main menu. For more information, see [How to Report a Problem with Visual Studio 2017](how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017.md).  

## I want to make a suggestion about Visual Studio features  
 If there's something we can do better, please let us know! Choose **Provide a Suggestion** to suggest a feature or change to the Visual Studio team. Your suggestion will automatically be posted to [UserVoice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com) where others can vote for it.  

### Rate this product  
 Pre-release versions of Visual Studio have a **Rate this Product** menu item that enables you to send feedback on the quality of the build you are running. You won't see this in released versions of the product.  

## I want to contact Microsoft Support  
For Visual Studio support options, see our [Support Overview](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/support/) page.

For other Microsoft products and services, see [Microsoft Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99019) for online help.

> [!NOTE]
> Support outside the United States and Canada may vary. For a list of regional contacts, see [Microsoft Worldwide Sites](http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/).  

For larger organizations that require managed support directly from Microsoft, contracts are available through various Premier Support offerings. For more information, see [Microsoft Services Premier Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=258223).  

If the product came installed with a new computer or device, the hardware manufacturer provides technical support and assistance for this software. Contact the manufacturer directly for support.  

Microsoft support services are subject to then-current prices, terms, and conditions. Prices, terms, and conditions are subject to change without notice.  

## I want to get involved in the developer community  
 If you want to share your questions and answers with other developers, you can use the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/index.html) site, the [MSDN Forums](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/home), or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). You can also view code from other developers and share your own examples on the [Developer code samples](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/) and [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/) websites. And last but not least, you can share your expertise by responding to customer feedback in the Comments section on any Visual Studio page on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/).

## I want to help improve the Visual Studio documentation  
  Please use our feedback button (**Was this page helpful?**) at the bottom of the page. You can find this button on all our documentation pages. If you're looking for an answer and you can't find it, please tell us what information you're looking for. (Alternatively, you can add feedback to any Visual Studio page on  [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/) by using the Comments section.)
