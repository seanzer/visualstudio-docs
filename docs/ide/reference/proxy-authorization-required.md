# Proxy Authorization Required
This error generally occurs when users are connected to the internet through a proxy server, and the proxy server blocks the calls that Visual Studio makes to some network resources.    
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Restart Visual Studio. A proxy authentication dialog box should appear. Enter your credentials in the dialog.  
  
-   If the above step does not solve the problem, this may be because your proxy server does not prompt for credentials for http://go.microsoft.com addresses but does so for *.visualStudio.com addresses. For these servers, you need to whitelist the following list of URLs to unblock all sign-in scenarios in Visual Studio:  
  
    -   *.windows.net  
  
    -   *.microsoftonline.com  
  
    -   *.visualstudio.com  
  
    -   *.microsoft.com  
  
    -   *.live.com  
  
-   You can otherwise remove the http://go.microsoft.com address from the whitelist so that the proxy authentication dialog shows up for both the http://go.microsoft.com address and the server endpoints when Visual Studio is restarted.  
  
    OR  
  
-   If you want to use your default credentials with your proxy, you can do the following:  
  
    1.  Find **devenv.exe.config** (the devenv.exe configuration file) in: **%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE** or **%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE**.  
  
    2.  In the configuration file, find the `<system.net>` block, and add this code:  
  
        ```xml  
        <defaultProxy enabled="true" useDefaultCredentials="true">  
            <proxy bypassonlocal="True" proxyaddress=" HYPERLINK "http://<yourproxy:port#" http://<yourproxy:port#>"/>  
        </defaultProxy>  
  
        ```  
  
        You must insert the correct proxy address for your network in `proxyaddress="<http://<yourproxy:port#>`.  
  
    OR  
  
-   You can also follow the instructions in [this post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rido/archive/2010/05/06/how-to-connect-to-tfs-through-authenticated-web-proxy.aspx) to add code that will allow you to use the proxy.
