# How to: Programmatically Delete Worksheets from Workbooks
  You can delete any worksheet in a workbook. To delete a worksheet, use the worksheet host item or access the worksheet by using the sheets collection of the workbook.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]  
  
## Using the Worksheet Host Item  
 If the worksheet was added at design-time in a document-level customization, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Delete%2A> method to delete a specified worksheet. The following code deletes a worksheet from a workbook by referencing the worksheet host item directly.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This code runs only in projects that you create by using any of the following project templates:  
>   
>  -   Excel 2013 Workbook  
> -   Excel 2013 Template  
> -   Excel 2010 Workbook  
> -   Excel 2010 Template  
>   
>  If you want to perform this task in any other type of project, you must add a reference to the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel** assembly, and then you must use classes from that assembly to open a workbook and delete a worksheet. For more information, see [How to: Target Office Applications Through Primary Interop Assemblies](../vsto/how-to-target-office-applications-through-primary-interop-assemblies.md) and [Excel 2010 Primary Interop Assembly Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=189585).  
  
#### To delete a worksheet by using a worksheet host item  
  
1.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Delete%2A> method of `Sheet1`.  
  
     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#17](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#17)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#17](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#17)]  
  
## Using the Sheets Collection of the Excel Workbook  
 Access worksheets through the Microsoft Office Excel <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection in the following cases:  
  
-   You want to delete a worksheet in a VSTO Add-in.  
  
-   The worksheet that you want to delete was created at run time in a document-level customization.  
  
 The following code deletes a worksheet from a workbook by referencing the sheet through the index number of the **Sheets** collection. This code assumes that a new worksheet was created programmatically.

>  If you want to perform this task in any other type of project, you must add a reference to the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel** assembly, and then you must use classes from that assembly to open a workbook and delete a worksheet.

#### To delete a worksheet by using the Sheets collection of the Excel workbook  
  
1.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Worksheet.Delete%2A> method of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection.
