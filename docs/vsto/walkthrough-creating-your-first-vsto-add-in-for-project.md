# Walkthrough: Creating Your First VSTO Add-in for Project
  This walkthrough shows you how to create an VSTO Add-in for Microsoft Office Project. The features that you create in this kind of solution are available to the application itself, regardless of which projects are open. For more information, see [Office Solutions Development Overview &#40;VSTO&#41;](../vsto/office-solutions-development-overview-vsto.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_projallapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-projallapp-md.md)]  
  
 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  
  
-   Creating a Project VSTO Add-in project.  
  
-   Writing code that uses the object model of Project to add a task to a new project.  
  
-   Building and running the project to test it.  
  
-   Cleaning up the completed project so that the VSTO Add-in no longer runs automatically on your development computer.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../sharepoint/includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vsto_vsprereq](../vsto/includes/vsto-vsprereq-md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[Project_15_short](../vsto/includes/project-15-short-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[Project_14_short](../vsto/includes/project-14-short-md.md)].  
  
## Creating the Project  
  
#### To create a new project in Visual Studio  
  
1.  Start [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.  
  
3.  In the templates pane, expand **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic**, and then expand **Office/SharePoint**.  
  
4.  Under the expanded **Office/SharePoint** node, select the **Office Add-ins** node.  
  
5.  In the list of project templates, select **Project 2010 Add-in** or **Project 2013 Add-in**.  
  
6.  In the **Name** box, type **FirstProjectAddIn**.  
  
7.  Click **OK**.  
  
     [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] creates the **FirstProjectAddIn** project and opens the **ThisAddIn** code file in the editor.  
  
## Writing Code that Adds a New Task to a Project  
 Next, add code to the ThisAddIn code file. The new code uses the object model of Project to add a new task to a project. By default, the ThisAddIn code file contains the following generated code:  
  
-   A partial definition of the `ThisAddIn` class. This class provides an entry point for your code and provides access to the object model of Project. For more information, see [Programming VSTO Add-Ins](../vsto/programming-vsto-add-ins.md). The remainder of the `ThisAddIn` class is defined in a hidden code file that you should not modify.  
  
-   The `ThisAddIn_Startup` and `ThisAddIn_Shutdown` event handlers. These event handlers are called when Project loads and unloads your VSTO Add-in. Use these event handlers to initialize your VSTO Add-in when it is loaded, and to clean up resources used by your VSTO Add-in when it is unloaded. For more information, see [Events in Office Projects](../vsto/events-in-office-projects.md).  
  
#### To add a task to a new project  
  
1.  In the ThisAddIn code file, add the following code to the `ThisAddIn` class. This code defines an event handler for the NewProject event of the Microsoft.Office.Interop.MSProject.Application class.  
  
     When the user creates a new project, this event handler adds a task to the project.  
  
     [!code-vb[Trin_ProjectAddInTutorial#1](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_ProjectAddInTutorial/ThisAddIn.vb#1)]
     [!code-csharp[Trin_ProjectAddInTutorial#1](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_ProjectAddInTutorial/ThisAddIn.cs#1)]  
  
 To modify the project, this code example use the following objects:  
  
-   The `Application` field of the `ThisAddIn` class. The `Application` field returns an Microsoft.Office.Interop.MSProject.Application object, which represents the current instance of Project.  
  
-   The `pj` parameter of the event handler for the NewProject event. The `pj` parameter is a Microsoft.Office.Interop.MSProject.Project object, which represents the project. For more information, see [Project Solutions](../vsto/project-solutions.md).  
  
1.  If you are using C#, add the following code to the `ThisAddIn_Startup` event handler. This code connects the `Application_Newproject` event handler with the NewProject event.  
  
     [!code-csharp[Trin_ProjectAddInTutorial#2](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_ProjectAddInTutorial/ThisAddIn.cs#2)]  
  
-  
  
## Testing the Project  
 When you build and run the project, verify that the new task appears in the resulting new project.  
  
#### To test the project  
  
1.  Press **F5** to build and run your project. Microsoft Project starts and automatically opens a new blank project.  
  
     When you build the project, the code is compiled into an assembly that is included in the build output folder for the project. Visual Studio also creates a set of registry entries that enable Project to discover and load the VSTO Add-in, and it configures the security settings on the development computer to enable the VSTO Add-in to run. For more information, see [Office Solution Build Process Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a9d12e4f-c9ea-4a62-a841-c42b91f831ee).  
  
2.  Verify that a new task is added to the blank project.  
  
3.  Verify that the following text appears in the **Task Name** field of the task.  
  
     **This text was added by using code.**  
  
4.  Close Microsoft Project.  
  
## Cleaning up the Project  
 When you finish developing a project, remove the VSTO Add-in assembly, registry entries, and security settings from your development computer. Otherwise, the VSTO Add-in will run every time you open Microsoft Project on the development computer.  
  
#### To clean up your project  
  
1.  In Visual Studio, on the **Build** menu, click **Clean Solution**.  
  
## Next Steps  
 Now that you have created a basic VSTO Add-in for Project, you can learn more about how to develop VSTO Add-ins from these topics:  
  
-   General programming tasks that you can perform in VSTO Add-ins for Project: [Programming VSTO Add-Ins](../vsto/programming-vsto-add-ins.md).  
  
-   Using the object model of Project: [Project Solutions](../vsto/project-solutions.md).  
  
-   Building and debugging VSTO Add-ins for Project: [Building Office Solutions](../vsto/building-office-solutions.md).  
  
-   Deploying VSTO Add-ins for Project: [Deploying an Office Solution](../vsto/deploying-an-office-solution.md).
