# How to: Programmatically Group Rows in a Worksheet
  You can group one or more whole rows. To create a group in a worksheet, use a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control or a native Excel range object.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]  
  
## Using a NamedRange Control  
 If you add a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control to a document-level project at design time, you can use the control to programmatically create a group. The following example assumes that there are three <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> controls on the same worksheet: `data2001`, `data2002`, and `dataAll`. Each named range refers to a whole row in the worksheet.  
  
#### To create a group of NamedRange controls on a worksheet  
  
1.  Group three named ranges by calling the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Group%2A> method of each range. This code must be placed in a sheet class, not in the `ThisWorkbook` class.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#32](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#32)]  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To ungroup rows, call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Ungroup%2A> method.  
  
## Using Native Excel Ranges  
 The code assumes that you have three Excel ranges named `data2001`, `data2002`, and `dataAll` on a worksheet.  
  
#### To create a group of Excel ranges in a worksheet  
  
1.  Group three named ranges by calling the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.Group%2A> method of each range. The following example assumes that there are three <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range> controls named `data2001`, `data2002`, and `dataAll` on the same worksheet. Each named range refers to a whole row in the worksheet.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#33](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#33)]  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To ungroup rows, call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.Ungroup%2A> method.
