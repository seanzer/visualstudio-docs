# Persisting Dynamic Controls in Office Documents
  Controls that are added at run time are not persisted when the document or workbook is saved and closed. The exact behavior is different for host controls and Windows Forms controls. In both cases, you can add code to your solution to re-create the controls when the user reopens the document.  
  
 Controls that you add to documents at run time are called *dynamic controls*. For more information about dynamic controls, see [Adding Controls to Office Documents at Run Time](../vsto/adding-controls-to-office-documents-at-run-time.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_controls](../vsto/includes/appliesto-controls-md.md)]  
  
## Persisting Host Controls in the Document  
 When a document is saved and then closed, all dynamic host controls are removed from the document. Only the underlying native Office objects remain behind. For example, a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> host control becomes a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ListObject>. The native Office objects are not connected to the host control events, and they do not have the data binding functionality of the host control.  
  
 The following table lists the native Office object that is left behind in a document for each type of host control.  
  
|Host control type|Native Office object type|  
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart>|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Chart>|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject>|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ListObject>|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange>|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range>|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.Bookmark>|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Bookmark>|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.BuildingBlockGalleryContentControl><br /><br /> <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.ComboBoxContentControl><br /><br /> <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.ContentControl><br /><br /> <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.DatePickerContentControl><br /><br /> <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.DropDownListContentControl><br /><br /> <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.GroupContentControl><br /><br /> <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.PictureContentControl><br /><br /> <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.PlainTextContentControl><br /><br /> <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.RichTextContentControl>|<xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.ContentControl>|  
  
### Re-Creating Dynamic Host Controls When Documents Are Opened  
 You can re-create dynamic host controls in place of existing native controls every time a user opens the document. Creating host controls in this manner when a document is opened simulates the experience that users might expect.  
  
 To re-create a host control for Word, or a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> or <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> host control for Excel, use an `Add`\<*control class*> method of an <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ControlCollection> or <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.ControlCollection> object. Use a method that has a parameter for the native Office object.  
  
 For example, if you want to create a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> host control from an existing native <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ListObject> when the document is opened, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ControlCollection.AddListObject%2A> method and pass in the existing <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ListObject>. The following code example demonstrates this in a document-level project for Excel. The code re-creates a dynamic <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> that is based on an existing <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ListObject> named `MyListObject` in the `Sheet1` class.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Trin_ExcelWorkbookDynamicControls#6](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/trin_excelworkbookdynamiccontrols4/Sheet1.cs#6)]
 [!code-vb[Trin_ExcelWorkbookDynamicControls#6](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/trin_excelworkbookdynamiccontrols4/Sheet1.vb#6)]  
  
### Re-Creating Charts  
 To re-create a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> host control, you must first delete the native <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Chart>, and then re-create the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> by using the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ControlCollection.AddChart%2A> or <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ControlCollection.AddChart%2A> method. There is no `Add`\<*control class*> method that enables you to create a new <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> based on an existing <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Chart>.  
  
 If you do not first delete the native <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Chart>, then you will create a second, duplicate chart when you re-create the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart>.  
  
## Persisting Windows Forms Controls in Documents  
 When a document is saved and then closed, the [!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](../vsto/includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)] automatically removes all dynamically created Windows Forms controls from the document. However, the behavior is different for document-level and VSTO Add-in projects.  
  
 In document-level customizations, the controls and their underlying ActiveX wrappers (which are used to host the controls on the document) are removed the next time the document is opened. There is no indication that the controls were ever there.  
  
 In VSTO Add-ins, the controls are removed, but the ActiveX wrappers remain in the document. The next time the user opens the document, the ActiveX wrappers are visible. In Excel, the ActiveX wrappers display images of the controls as they appeared the last time the document was saved. In Word, the ActiveX wrappers are invisible unless the user clicks on them, in which case they display a dotted line that represents the border of the controls. There are several ways you can remove the ActiveX wrappers. For more information, see [Removing ActiveX Wrappers in an Add-in](#removingActiveX).  
  
### Re-Creating Windows Forms Controls When Documents Are Opened  
 You can re-create deleted Windows Forms controls when the user reopens the document. To do this, your solution must perform the following tasks:  
  
1.  Store information about the size, location, and state of the controls when the document is saved or closed. In a document-level customization, you can save this data to the data cache in the document. In an VSTO Add-in, you can save this data to a custom XML part in the document.  
  
2.  Re-create the controls in an event that is raised when the document is opened. In document-level projects, you can do this in the `Sheet`*n*`_Startup` or `ThisDocument_Startup` event handlers. In VSTO Add-in projects, you can do this in the event handlers for the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.AppEvents_Event.WorkbookOpen> or <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.ApplicationEvents4_Event.DocumentOpen> events.  
  
###  <a name="removingActiveX"></a> Removing ActiveX Wrappers in an Add-in  
 When you add dynamic Windows Forms controls to documents by using an VSTO Add-in, you can prevent the ActiveX wrappers for the controls from appearing in the document the next time it is opened in the following ways.  
  
#### Removing ActiveX Wrappers When the Document Is Opened  
 To remove all ActiveX wrappers, call the GetVstoObject method to generate a host item for the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document> or <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbook> that represents the newly opened document. For example, to remove all ActiveX wrappers from a Word document, you can call the GetVstoObject method to generate a host item for the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document> object that is passed to the event handler for the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.ApplicationEvents4_Event.DocumentOpen> event.  
  
 This procedure is useful when you know that the document will be opened only on computers that have the VSTO Add-in installed. If the document might be passed to other users who do not have the VSTO Add-in installed, consider removing the controls before closing the document instead.  
  
 The following code example demonstrates how to call the GetVstoObject method when the document is opened.  
  
 [!code-vb[Trin_WordAddInDynamicControls#11](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/trin_wordaddindynamiccontrols/ThisAddIn.vb#11)]
 [!code-csharp[Trin_WordAddInDynamicControls#11](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_WordAddInDynamicControls/ThisAddIn.cs#11)]  
  
 Although the GetVstoObject method is used primarily to generate a new host item at run time, this method also clears all ActiveX wrappers from the document the first time it is called for a specific document. For more information about how to use the GetVstoObject method, see [Extending Word Documents and Excel Workbooks in VSTO Add-ins at Run Time](../vsto/extending-word-documents-and-excel-workbooks-in-vsto-add-ins-at-run-time.md).  
  
 Note that if your VSTO Add-in creates dynamic controls when the document is opened, your VSTO Add-in will already call the GetVstoObject method as part of the process to create the controls. You do not need to add a separate call to the GetVstoObject method to remove the ActiveX wrappers in this scenario.  
  
#### Removing the Dynamic Controls Before the Document Is Closed  
 Your VSTO Add-in can explicitly remove each dynamic control from the document before the document is closed. This procedure is useful for documents that might be passed to other users who do not have the VSTO Add-in installed.  
  
 The following code example demonstrates how to remove all of the Windows Forms controls from a Word document when the document is closed.  
  
 [!code-vb[Trin_WordAddInDynamicControls#10](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/trin_wordaddindynamiccontrols/ThisAddIn.vb#10)]
 [!code-csharp[Trin_WordAddInDynamicControls#10](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_WordAddInDynamicControls/ThisAddIn.cs#10)]
