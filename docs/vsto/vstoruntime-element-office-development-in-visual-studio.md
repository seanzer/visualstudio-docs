# &lt;vstoRuntime&gt; Element (Office Development in Visual Studio)
  The `vstoRuntime` element of the `vstav3` namespace contains a supported version of the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime for a specific Office solution.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
<vstoRuntime  
    release  
    version  
    supportUrl />  
```  
  
## Elements and Attributes  
 The `vstoRuntime` element is required and is in the `vstav3` namespace. If an Office solution supports two versions of the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime, there are two `vstoRuntime` elements in the application manifest.  
  
 The `vstoRuntime` element has the following attributes.  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`release`|Required. The release version of the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime.|  
|`version`|Required. Version number of the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime.|  
|`supportUrl`|Optional. Link to the installation location of the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime.|  
  
 `vstoRuntime` has no elements.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example illustrates the `vstoRuntime` element in an application manifest for an Office solution deployed by using [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../vsto/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)]. This code example is part of a larger example provided in [Application Manifests for Office Solutions](../vsto/application-manifests-for-office-solutions.md).  
  
```  
<vstav3:vstoRuntime  
    release="VSTOR40Beta1"  
    version="10.0.20303"  
    supportUrl="http://www.microsoft.com" />  
```
