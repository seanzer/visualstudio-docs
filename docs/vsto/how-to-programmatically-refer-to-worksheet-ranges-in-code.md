# How to: Programmatically Refer to Worksheet Ranges in Code
  You use a similar process to refer to the contents of a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control or a native Excel range object.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]  
  
## Using a NamedRange Control  
 The following example adds a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> to a worksheet and then adds text to the cell in the range.  
  
#### To refer to a NamedRange control  
  
1.  Assign a string to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Value2%2A> property of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control. This code must be placed in a sheet class, not in the `ThisWorkbook` class.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#46](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#46)]  
  
## Using Native Excel Ranges  
 The following example adds a native Excel range to a worksheet and then adds text to the cell in the range.  
  
#### To refer to a native range object  
  
1.  Assign a string to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.Value2%2A> property of the range.
