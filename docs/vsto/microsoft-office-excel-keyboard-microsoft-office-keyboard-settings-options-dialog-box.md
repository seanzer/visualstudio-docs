# Microsoft Office Excel Keyboard, Microsoft Office Keyboard Settings, Options Dialog Box
  Microsoft Office Excel and Visual Studio both handle shortcut keys. The same shortcut key combination can stand for different commands in Excel and in Visual Studio. When Excel is open in a document-level project in Visual Studio, only one application at a time receives the shortcut key commands. By default, Visual Studio receives all shortcut key commands, but you can make Excel receive them when the document has focus by selecting **Dynamic keyboard scheme**.  
  
 If you use a shortcut key that is not assigned to a command in the application that is currently handling the shortcut keys, the shortcut key is passed on to the other application.  
  
 The option that you select will remain in effect for Excel projects until you change it. The selection does not affect Microsoft Office Word projects; you must make any change for Word using the Microsoft Office Word Keyboard options.  
  
## UIElement List  
 **Visual Studio keyboard scheme**  
 Visual Studio receives all shortcut key commands, even if Excel has focus. For example, if you press the function key F5 while Excel has focus, Visual Studio starts debugging your solution.  
  
 **Dynamic keyboard scheme**  
 Visual Studio receives shortcut key commands only when it has focus. When Excel has focus, Excel receives all shortcut key commands. For example, if you press the function key F5 while Excel has focus, Excel opens the **Go To** dialog box. If you press F5 while Visual Studio has focus, Visual Studio starts debugging your solution.
