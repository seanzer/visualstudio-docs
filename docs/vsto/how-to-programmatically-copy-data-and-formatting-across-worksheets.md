# How to: Programmatically Copy Data and Formatting across Worksheets
  You can copy data from a range on one sheet to all the other sheets in a workbook by using the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Worksheets.FillAcrossSheets%2A> method. Specify a range, and whether you want to copy data, formatting, or both.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#44](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#44)]
 [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#44](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#44)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires a range named `rangeData` in a worksheet.
