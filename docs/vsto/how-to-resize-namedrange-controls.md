# How to: Resize NamedRange Controls
  You can set the size of a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control when you add it to a Microsoft Office Excel document; however, you might want to resize it at a later time.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]  
  
 You can resize a named range at design time or at run time in document-level projects. You can also resize named ranges at run time in application-level VSTO Add-ins.  
  
 This topic describes the following tasks:

-   [Resizing NamedRange controls at run time in a document-level project](#runtimedoclevel)  
  
-   [Resizing NamedRange controls at run time in an VSTO Add-in project](#runtimeaddin)  
  
##  <a name="designtime"></a> Resizing NamedRange Controls at Design Time  
 You can resize a named range by redefining its size in the **Define Name** dialog box.

##  <a name="runtimedoclevel"></a> Resizing NamedRange Controls at Run Time in a Document-Level Project  
 You can resize a named range programmatically by using the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.RefersTo%2A> property.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In the **Properties** window, the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.RefersTo%2A> property is marked as read-only.  
  
#### To resize a named range programmatically  
  
1.  Create a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control on cell **A1** of `Sheet1`.
