# NamedRange Control
  The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control is a range that has a unique name, exposes events, and can be bound to data. For more information, see [Excel Object Model Overview](../vsto/excel-object-model-overview.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]  
  
## Creating the Control  
 You can add <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> controls to a Microsoft Office Excel worksheet at design time or at run time in document-level projects.  
  
 You can add <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> controls to a worksheet at run time in an VSTO Add-in. For more information, see [How to: Add NamedRange Controls to Worksheets](../vsto/how-to-add-namedrange-controls-to-worksheets.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  By default, dynamically created named ranges are not persisted in the worksheet as host controls when the worksheet is closed. For more information, see [Adding Controls to Office Documents at Run Time](../vsto/adding-controls-to-office-documents-at-run-time.md).  
  
 <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> controls can only consist of ranges on specific sheets. <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> controls cannot have relative names that apply to all sheets, and they cannot consist of ranges that span two or more worksheets in a workbook (3-D ranges).  
  
## Binding Data to the Control  
 A named range would appear to be a good candidate for complex data binding since it can have many cells; however, a range is merely a collection of cells that cannot be easily mapped to a particular column from a dataset. Therefore, <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> controls only support simple data binding. The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> control can be used for complex data binding. For more information, see [ListObject Control](../vsto/listobject-control.md).  
  
 The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control can be bound to a data source using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DataBindings%2A> properties. The default data binding property of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control is <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Value2%2A>.  
  
 If the data in the bound dataset is updated through any mechanism, the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control reflects the changes.  
  
## Formatting  
 Formatting that can be applied to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range> can be applied to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control. This includes borders, fonts, number format and styles.  
  
## Renaming the Control  
 When you add a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control to your worksheet from the **Toolbox**, Visual Studio automatically generates a name for the control. You can change the name in the **Properties** window.  
  
## Events  
 The following events are available for the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control:  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.BeforeDoubleClick>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.BeforeRightClick>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.BindingContextChanged>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Change>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Deselected>  
  
-   <xref:System.ComponentModel.Component.Disposed>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Selected>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.SelectionChange>
