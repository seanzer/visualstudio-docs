# How to: Add a Dialog Box Launcher to a Ribbon Group
  You can add a dialog box launcher to any group on a Ribbon. A dialog box launcher is a small icon that appears in a group. Users click this icon to open related dialog boxes or task panes that provide more options that relate to the group.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_ribbon](../vsto/includes/appliesto-ribbon-md.md)]  
  
### To add a dialog box launcher to a Ribbon group  
  
1.  Select the Ribbon code file (.vb or .cs file) in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
2.  On the **View** menu, click **Designer**.  
  
3.  In the Ribbon Designer, right-click any group, and then click **Add DialogBoxLauncher**.  
  
     Add code to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Ribbon.RibbonGroup.DialogLauncherClick> event of the group to open a custom or built-in dialog box.
