# How to: Programmatically Send E-Mail  
  This example sends an e-mail message to contacts that have the domain name **example.com** in their e-mail addresses.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_olkallapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-olkallapp-md.md)]  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[Trin_OL_ProgramEmail#1](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_OL_ProgramEMail/thisaddin.cs#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   Contacts that have the domain name **example.com** in their e-mail addresses.  
  
## Robust Programming  
 Do not remove the filter code that searches for the domain name **example.com**. Your solution will send e-mail messages to all of your contacts if you remove the filter.
