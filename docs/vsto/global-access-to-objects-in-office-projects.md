# Global Access to Objects in Office Projects
  When you create an Office project, Visual Studio automatically generates a class named `Globals` in the project. You can use the `Globals` class to access several different project items at run time from any code in the project.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_all](../vsto/includes/appliesto-all-md.md)]  
  
## How to Use the Globals Class  
 `Globals` is a static class that keeps references to certain items in your project. By using the `Globals` class, you can access the following items from any code in the project at run time:  
  
-   The `ThisWorkbook` and `Sheet`*n* classes in an Excel workbook or template project. You can access these objects by using the `Globals.ThisWorkbook` and `Sheet`*n* properties.  
  
-   The `ThisDocument` class in a Word document or template project. You can access this object by using the `Globals.ThisDocument` property.  
  
-   The `ThisAddIn` class in an VSTO Add-in project. You can access this object by using the `Globals.ThisAddIn` property.  
  
-   All Ribbons in your project that you customized by using the Ribbon Designer. You can access the Ribbons by using the `Globals.Ribbons` property. For more information, see [Accessing the Ribbon at Run Time](../vsto/accessing-the-ribbon-at-run-time.md).  
  
-   All Outlook form regions in an Outlook VSTO Add-in project. You can access the form regions by using the `Globals.FormRegions` property. For more information, see [Accessing a Form Region at Run Time](../vsto/accessing-a-form-region-at-run-time.md).  
  
-   A factory object that enables you to create Ribbon controls, and host items at run time in projects that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../sharepoint/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../vsto/includes/net-v45-md.md)]. You can access this object by using the `Globals.Factory` property. This object is an instance of a class that implements one the following interfaces:  
  
    -   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Factory>  
  
    -   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Factory>  
  
    -   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Outlook.Factory>  
  
    -   <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.Factory>  
  
 For example, you can use the `Globals.Sheet1` property to insert text into a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control on `Sheet1` when a user clicks a button on the actions pane in a document-level project for Excel.  
  
 [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreProgramming#1](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingExcelVB/Sheet1.vb#1)]
 [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreProgramming#1](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingExcelCS/Sheet1.cs#1)]  
  
## Initializing the Globals Class  
 Code that attempts to use the `Globals` class before the document or VSTO Add-in is completely initialized might throw a run time exception. For example, using `Globals` when declaring a class-level variable might fail because the `Globals` class might not be initialized with references to all of the host items before the declared object is instantiated.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The `Globals` class is never initialized at design time, but control instances are created by the designer. This means that if you create a user control that uses a property of the `Globals` class from inside a user control class, you must whether the property returns **null** before you try to use the returned object.
