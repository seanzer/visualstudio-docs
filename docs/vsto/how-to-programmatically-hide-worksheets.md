# How to: Programmatically Hide Worksheets
  You can show or hide any worksheet in a workbook. To hide a worksheet, use the worksheet host item or access the worksheet by using the sheets collection of the workbook.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]  
  
## Using the Worksheet Host Item  
 If the worksheet was added at design-time in a document-level customization, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Visible%2A> property to hide the specified worksheet.  
  
#### To hide a worksheet using a worksheet host item  
  
1.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Visible%2A> property of the `Sheet1` host item to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlSheetVisibility.xlSheetHidden> enumeration value.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#25](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#25)]  
  
## Using the Sheets Collection of the Excel Workbook  
 Access worksheets through the Microsoft Office Excel <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection in the following cases:  
  
-   You want to hide a worksheet in an VSTO Add-in.  
  
-   The worksheet that you want to hide was created at run time in a document-level customization.  
  
#### To hide a worksheet using the Sheets collection of the Excel workbook  
  
1.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Worksheets.Visible%2A> property of the worksheet to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlSheetVisibility.xlSheetHidden> enumeration value.
