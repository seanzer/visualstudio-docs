# Architecture of Office Solutions in Visual Studio
  The topics in this section provide information about how solutions created by using the Office developer tools in Visual Studio work.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Interested in developing solutions that extend the Office experience across [multiple platforms](https://dev.office.com/add-in-availability)? Check out the new [Office Add-ins model](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins). Office Add-ins have a small footprint compared to VSTO add-ins and solutions, and you can build them by using almost any web programming technology, such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and XML.
