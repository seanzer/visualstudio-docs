# How AutoSave Impacts Office Solutions

AutoSave is a feature for Excel, PowerPoint and Word that, when turned on, enables the userâ€™s edits to be saved automatically and continuously. If AutoSave is turned off, then save must be triggered manually for the user's changes to be persisted. With the addition of this feature, you may need to make adjustments to your Office solution in order to ensure that it works smoothly even while AutoSave is on. For details, see [How AutoSave impacts add-ins and macros](https://msdn.microsoft.com/vba/office-shared-vba/articles/how-autosave-impacts-addins-and-macros). For more information about AutoSave in general, see [What is AutoSave?](https://support.office.com/en-US/article/What-is-AutoSave-6d6bd723-ebfd-4e40-b5f6-ae6e8088f7a5).

Note: AutoSave for Windows Desktop Word, Excel and PowerPoint was introduced in 2017 and is currently available for Office365 subscribers. Users who purchased a perpetual license to Office 2016 or earlier do not currently have access to the coauthoring feature. (Excel Online, Excel for Android, Excel for iOS, and Excel Mobile in the Windows Store also support AutoSave).
