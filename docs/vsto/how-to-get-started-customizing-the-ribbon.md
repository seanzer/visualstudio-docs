# How to: Get Started Customizing the Ribbon
  To customize the Ribbon of a Microsoft Office application, add a **Ribbon (Visual Designer)** or **Ribbon (XML)** item to an Office project.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_ribbon](../vsto/includes/appliesto-ribbon-md.md)]  
  
### To add a Ribbon to a project  
  
1.  On the **Project** Menu, click **Add New Item**.  
  
2.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **Ribbon (Visual Designer)** or **Ribbon (XML)**. For more information about these templates, see [Ribbon Overview](../vsto/ribbon-overview.md).  
  
3.  In the **Name** box, type a name for the Ribbon item.  
  
     Names cannot contain the following characters:  
  
    -   Pound (#)  
  
    -   Percent (%)  
  
    -   Ampersand (&)  
  
    -   Asterisk (*)  
  
    -   Vertical bar (|)  
  
    -   Backslash (\\)  
  
    -   Colon (:)  
  
    -   Double quotation mark (")  
  
    -   Less than (\<)  
  
    -   Greater than (>)  
  
    -   Question mark (?)  
  
    -   Forward slash (/)  
  
    -   Leading or trailing spaces (' ')  
  
    -   Names reserved for Windows or DOS such as ("nul", "aux", "con", "com1", "lpt1", and so on)  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
 The Ribbon item appears in **Solution Explorer**. For information about the next steps, see [Ribbon Overview](../vsto/ribbon-overview.md).
