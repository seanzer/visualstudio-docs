# How to: Programmatically Select Worksheets
  The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Select%2A> method selects the specified object, which moves the user's selection to the new object. Use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Activate%2A> method if you want to bring focus to the object without changing the user's selection.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]  
  
 If you want to select an existing worksheet in a VSTO Add-in or if the worksheet was created at run time in a document-level customization, you must access it by using the Excel <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection of the Excel workbook; otherwise, you can access the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet> host item directly.  
  
## Using the Worksheet Host Item  
 In a document-level customization, add the following code to **Sheet1.vb** or **Sheet1.cs**.  
  
#### To select the first worksheet in a workbook using a host item  
  
1.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Select%2A> method of `Sheet1`.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#19](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#19)]  
  
## Using the Sheets Collection of the Excel Workbook  
 Access the worksheet by using the Excel <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection.  
  
#### To select the first worksheet in a workbook using the Sheets collection of the Excel workbook  
  
1.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets.Select%2A> method of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection to select the first worksheet of the active workbook.
