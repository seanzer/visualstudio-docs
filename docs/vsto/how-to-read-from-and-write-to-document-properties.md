# How to: Read from and Write to Document Properties
  You can store document properties along with a document. Office applications provide a number of built-in properties, such as author, title, and subject. This topic shows how to set document properties in Microsoft Office Excel and Microsoft Office Word.  
  
 ![link to video](../vsto/media/playvideo.gif "link to video") For a related video demonstration, see [How Do I: Access and Manipulate Custom Document Properties in Microsoft Word?](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=136772).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_docprops](../vsto/includes/appliesto-docprops-md.md)]  
  
## Setting Document Properties in Excel  
 To work with built-in properties in Excel, use the following properties:  
  
-   In a document-level project, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Workbook.BuiltinDocumentProperties%2A> property of the `ThisWorkbook` class.  
  
-   In a VSTO Add-in project, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Workbook.BuiltinDocumentProperties%2A> property of a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbook> object.  
  
 These properties return a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Core.DocumentProperties> object, which is a collection of <xref:Microsoft.Office.Core.DocumentProperty> objects. You can use the `Item` property of the collection to retrieve a particular property, either by name or by index within the collection.  
  
 The following code example shows how to change the built-in **Revision Number** property in a document-level project.  
  
#### To change the Revision Number property in Excel  
  
1.  Assign the built-in document properties to a variable.  
  
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreProgramming#7](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingExcelVB/ThisWorkbook.vb#7)]
     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreProgramming#7](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingExcelCS/ThisWorkbook.cs#7)]  
  
2.  Increment the `Revision Number` property by one.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreProgramming#8](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingExcelCS/ThisWorkbook.cs#8)]  
  
## Setting Document Properties in Word  
 To work with built-in properties in Word, use the following properties:  
  
-   In a document-level project, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.Document.BuiltInDocumentProperties%2A> property of the `ThisDocument` class.  
  
-   In a VSTO Add-in project, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word._Document.BuiltInDocumentProperties%2A> property of a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document> object.  
  
 These properties return a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Core.DocumentProperties> object, which is a collection of <xref:Microsoft.Office.Core.DocumentProperty> objects. You can use the `Item` property of the collection to retrieve a particular property, either by name or by index within the collection.  
  
 The following code example shows how to change the built-in **Subject** property in a document-level project.  
  
#### To change the Subject property  
  
1.  Assign the built-in document properties to a variable.  
  
     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreProgrammingWord#1](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingWordCS/ThisDocument.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreProgrammingWord#1](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingWordVB/ThisDocument.vb#1)]  
  
2.  Change the `Subject` property to "Whitepaper".  
  
     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreProgrammingWord#2](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingWordCS/ThisDocument.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreProgrammingWord#2](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingWordVB/ThisDocument.vb#2)]  
  
## Robust Programming  
 The examples assume that you have written the code in the `ThisWorkbook` class in a document-level project for Excel, and the `ThisDocument` class in a document-level project for Word.  
  
 Although you are working with Word and Excel and their objects, Microsoft Office supplies the list of available built-in document properties. Attempting to access an undefined property raises an exception.
