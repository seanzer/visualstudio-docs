# How to: Programmatically Remove Protection from Worksheets
  You can programmatically remove protection from a Microsoft Office Excel worksheet.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]  
  
 The following example uses the variable `getPasswordFromUser`, which contains a password obtained from the user.  
  
### To unprotect a worksheet in a document-level customization  
  
1.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Unprotect%2A> method of the worksheet and pass in the password, if required. This example assumes that you are working with a worksheet named `Sheet1`.  
  
     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#28](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#28)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#28](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#28)]  
  
### To unprotect a worksheet in an VSTO Add-in  
  
1.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Worksheet.Unprotect%2A> method of the active worksheet and pass in the password, if required.  
  
     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationAddIn#18](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/trin_vstcoreexcelautomationaddin/ThisAddIn.cs#18)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationAddIn#18](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/trin_vstcoreexcelautomationaddin/ThisAddIn.vb#18)]
