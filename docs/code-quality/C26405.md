# C26405  DONT_ASSIGN_TO_VALID
If an owner pointer already points to a valid memory buffer, it must not be assigned to another value without releasing its current resource first. Such assignment may lead to a resource leak even if the resource address is copied into some raw pointer (because raw pointers shouldnâ€™t release resources).

## Example 1: Overwriting an owner in a loop
```cpp
gsl::owner<Shape*> shape = nullptr;
while (shape = NextShape()) // C26405
    Process(shape) ? delete shape : 0;
```
