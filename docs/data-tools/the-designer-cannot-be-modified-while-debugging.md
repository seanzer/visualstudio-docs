# The designer cannot be modified while debugging
This message appears when an attempt is made to modify items on the O/R Designer when the application is running in debug mode. When the application is running in debug mode, the O/R Designer is read-only.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Click **Stop Debugging** on the **Debug** menu.  
  
     The application stops debugging, and items in the O/R Designer can be modified.
