# Activating the Power BI Pro Benefit in Visual Studio Subscriptions

Develop, test, and deploy add-ins for Office and SharePoint.  Includes a one-tenant SharePoint Online Developer Site. 

To use Power BI Pro, you’ll need to set up an account or sign in using an existing account. 
1.	Click on the **Get Code** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.   You’ll receive a notification that the code was successfully retrieved.  Click **Activate**.

2. You may already have an account if you’ve activated certain other subscription benefits, such as Office 365 Developer Subscription or Enterprise Mobility + Security.  If an existing account is found, you’ll have the choice to add your Power BI Pro subscription to your existing account or sign up for a new account.  We highly recommend adding it to your existing account so you can access your various benefits with a single user ID.

8.	The next page will confirm your Power BI Pro Developer (MSDN) subscription has a $0.00 price.  Click **Next**.
9.	 Finally, we’ll collect some payment information.  Don’t worry – you won’t be charged anything.  Notice that the price is still $0.00.  You can choose a credit card, bank account, or invoice as a form of payment.  If you choose **Invoice**, you may be asked for some feedback on why you prefer that payment method.  Please provide the information requested for your preferred payment method, and click **Place order**.

We recommend recording the link to the sign-in page as well as your user ID.  (You will also receive a welcome email at the address you provided when you set up the account.)  You may also see an automated Office 365 Assistant window, which you can use if you have questions.  Click **Let’s get started** to continue.
