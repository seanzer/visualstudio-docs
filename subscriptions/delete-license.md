# Deleting Assignments in Visual Studio Subscirptions

When a subscriber no longer requires a Visual Studio Subscription, such as when they leave the company, complete a project, or switch to a new job role, you can remove their subscription and  assign it to someone else. Please note that when you reassign a subscription, the subscriber benefits will be reset, with the exception of the product keys.  The new user will be able to claim any unclaimed keys and view previously claimed keys but claim limits are **not** reset. 
1.	Click the name of the subscriber you want to remove. To select multiple subscribers for removal, hold down the **CTRL** key and click each subscriber you wish to remove, or press **CTRL + A** to select and remove all subscribers. The image below shows three subscribers selected.
2.	To delete the selected subscriber(s), click **Delete**. When the message appears asking you to confirm the deletion, click **OK**.
