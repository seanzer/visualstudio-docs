# Activating the Technical Support Benefit in Visual Studio Subscriptions

Resolve break-fix issues in non-production environments.  (Note:  Benefit must by activated before you can submit a support request.)  Visual Studio Enterprise standard and annual cloud subscriptions receive four incidents, while Visual Studio Professional standard and annual cloud subscriptions receive two incidents.  

1.	To begin using your Technical Support benefit, click on **Activate** on the Technical Support tile.

2.	On the [Technical Support page](https://www.visualstudio.com/my/technical-support-vse), you’ll see instructions for activating your technical support benefit.  You’ll need a Contract ID and an Access ID, which our Technical Support team can set up for you.    
3.	If you haven’t already set up your Contract ID and Access ID, please contact the [Microsoft Technical Support number](http://support.microsoft.com/gp/customer-service-phone-numbers) for your country, and let them know you need to set up your technical support contract for your Visual Studio subscription.  It takes just a few minutes.  They’ll provide you with your Contract ID and Access ID, which you will want to record for future reference.  You’ll also receive an email with that information.  
 
4.	To activate your support account in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, choose your country from [this list](http://support.microsoft.com/activatesupport).   For all other geographies, please skip to step 7.
 
5.	The instructions on the **Activating a Support Contract** page will guide you through the process, which may vary by country.  In general, the steps involve downloading and completing an electronic registration form and emailing it to Microsoft.  Once it’s been processed and your account is ready, you’ll receive an email with your account details.  
 
6.	Once your account is set up, please go to step 8 to see how to submit a support incident online.  
7.	In all geographies other than Europe, the Middle East and Africa, you can get your account set up by calling our [Technical Support team](http://support.microsoft.com/gp/customer-service-phone-numbers) in your country.  To find the correct phone number for your country, simply click on the letter that corresponds to the name of your country.  You’ll see a list of countries that begin with that letter, along with phone numbers and the support languages for those locations.  If your country is not listed, choose the nearest country that provides support in your preferred language.  
 
8.	When you call, you’ll be asked to provide basic contact information, such as a name, phone number and email address.  You’ll also need to provide your subscription ID.  To locate that, click on the [Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) tab on the [Subscriber Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com).  You’ll see the Subscription IDs listed for your subscription(s).

9.	After your phone call, you will receive a confirmation email containing the Contract ID and Access ID that have been created for you.

10.	Once you have your Contract ID and Access ID set up, when you need support you can either call the same technical support number you called to set up your account, or [submit a support request online](http://support.microsoft.com/oas/).  If would prefer to receive support over the phone, you can still submit your request online, and a Microsoft Support Professional will call you back.

11.	To [submit an incident online](http://support.microsoft.com/oas/), specify the product you need help with.  You can either select from the various lists, or search for it by name.  To submit an incident for Visual Studio Enterprise 2017, for example, click on **Visual Studio** in the **Developer Tools** group.
