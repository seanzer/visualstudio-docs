# Activating the Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Benefit in Visual Studio Subscriptions

Most Visual Studio subscriptions include access to Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).  It’s the ultimate compliment to your IDE, providing free Git repros, Agile planning tools and hosted builds for any language.  

To use VSTS, you’ll need an account. You can sign in with an existing account, or create a new one.  To create a new account:
1.	Click on the “Get Started” link at the bottom of the benefit tile.

2.	Enter a name for your VSTS project site.  
3.  Choose whether you want to use **Git** or **Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)** to manage your project.  This is a permanent choice for each team project you create, but you can use both TFVC and Git team projects in the same team project collection.  Not sure which to use? 
- Git:  Git is a decentralized version control system. Each developer has a copy of the entire source repository on their dev machine. Developers can commit each set of changes on their dv machine and perform version control operations such as history and compare without a network connection.  [Learn more about Git](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/gitquickstart)
- TFVC: Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) is a centralized version control system. Typically, Team members have only one version of each file on their dev machines. Historical data is maintained only on the server. Branches are path-based and created on the server. [Learn more about Team Foundation Version Control](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/overview).
 
4.  Click **Change details** to customize options for Project name, how you organize your work (Agile, Scrum, CMMI), where to host your projects, and how to share your work with others.  Click “Continue”.

5.	It will take a moment to create your account, and then you’ll see the VSTS page for your first project, using the name you specified.  You’re now ready to begin using Visual Studio Team Services!

You will also receive an email confirming you have successfully created your account.  It also lists your account URL and sign-in and preferred email addresses.
