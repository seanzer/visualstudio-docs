4.	Provide a phone number and choose whether to receive a confirmation code via phone or text.  This helps us ensure the account is being created by a real person. Enter the code you receive and click **Next**
5.	You may be asked to sign in at this point.  If you have more than one account shown on the Office 365 login page, please choose the account you associated with this subscription.
6.	Provide the requested information about where you’ll be using the subscription and click **Next**.  The information is used to determine subscription availability and any applicable taxes.

7.	The next page will confirm that your subscription is available to you at no cost.  Click **Next** to continue.  
8.	Finally, we’ll collect some payment information.  Don’t worry – you won’t be charged anything.  Notice that the price is still $0.00.  You can choose a credit card, bank account, or invoice as a form of payment.  If you choose **Invoice**, you may be asked for some feedback on why you prefer that payment method.  Please provide the information requested for your preferred payment method, and click **Place order**.

9.	You’ll see a page confirming your order.  The page will provide a link to the [sign-in page](https://portal.office.com "Office 365 sign-in page").  We recommend bookmarking the page for later use.  You’ll also want to record the user ID shown on the page.  (You will also receive a welcome email at the address you provided when you set up the account.)  Click **Start setup** to continue.  
10.	You may be asked to provide some feedback about your experience setting up your subscription.  We’d love to hear your thoughts.
