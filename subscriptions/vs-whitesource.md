4.	In the **Activate your account** section of the page, you’ll be guided through four steps:
- [Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whitesource.ws-bolt) the WhiteSource Bolt extension from Microsoft Visual Studio marketplace. If you don’t have permissions to install extensions, please visit [this page](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/marketplace/get-vsts-extensions#request).

    Click the green **Install** button if you are using VSTS, or the **Download** button for Team Foundation Server.  For this example, we will use VSTS.
