# Signing in to the portal
Welcome to Visual Studio your Visual Studio subscriptiion!  Your subscription provides you with all the software and benefits you need to stay up on all things code, including software, monthly Azure credits, collaboration tools, training perks, support, and more—all the latest and greatest from Microsoft.  In order to use the portal, you’ll need to sign in.
## First time access
The steps to use your subscription for the first time depend on how you obtained your subscription.  
### Microsoft Store
If you've purchased a Visual Studio Subscription through the Microsoft Store, the activation steps can be initiated from the payment **Confirmation Page** or **Confirmation Email.**  
1.	On the “Confirmation Page” or in the “Confirmation Email”, click on **Click here to sign in**.  You will be redirected to https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate.
2.	Enter the email address you'll use to sign in to the Subscriber Portal and click **Continue**.
3.	Depending on the email address, you may be redirected to the Microsoft Account sign-in page, or your company/school's sign-in page.
4.	Enter your password, or complete sign in requirements.
5.	Enter the Product Key provided in your confirmation page or welcome email, and click **Activate**.

### Work/School accounts
If your subscription was provided by your work/school, you will have received a welcome email.  
1.	Visit the [Subscriber Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/)
2.	Enter the email address that was assigned the new Visual Studio subscription. This address is also identified in the subscriber **Welcome Letter**. Please check **Spam** folders if the **Welcome Letter** was not received.
3.	Click **Continue**
4.	You will be redirected to Corporate Sign in page.
5.	Enter your password.
6.	Click **Sign in**.

### Visual Studio Marketplace 
If you purchased a monthly or annual cloud subscription from the Visual Studio Marketplace, visit the [Subscriber Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/) and sign in with the Microsoft Account (MSA) you provided when you purchased the subscription.
### Using a work/school account with a Microsoft Account (MSA)
If your organization has an Azure Active Directory, but you don't have an Azure Active Directory Account you may need to leverage the **personal** options provided during the sign in process.
1.	Please go to the [Subscriber Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com)
2.	Enter the email address that was assigned the new Visual Studio subscription. This address is also identified in the subscriber **Welcome Letter**.  (Check your junk mail folders if you didn't receive the welcome email.)
3.	Click **Continue**
4.	You will be redirected to a **Decision Page**.   Select **Work or school account** if your Subscription is assigned to a **Work or School** account associated with an Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant.  Select **Personal** if the Subscription is associated with a **Corporate** email address, but has also been converted to a **Personal** Microsoft Account (MSA)
5.	Enter your password
6.	Click **Sign in** 

## Managing multiple subscriptions
The MY portal brings together all your Visual Studio subscriptions and programs in a single improved portal experience.  For example, you might have a standard subscription such as Visual Studio Enterprise through work, and a monthly Visual Studio Professional subscription or Visual Studio Dev Essentials membership you use at home. 
### Which subscription am I using?
On the Benefits page, the subscription in use will be prominently displayed in the blue banner.  It's also displayed in the upper-right of the page.

### If your subscription is not visible...
- It may be expired.  Only active subscriptions are displayed in the Subscriber Portal.
- It may be associated with a different email address. For example, if you sign in to a Visual Studio Professional subscription with your work/school email and have a Visual Studio Dev Essentials membership associated with your Microsoft Account, you will only see the subscription corresponding to the email address you used to sign in to the Subscriber Portal.  To see the other subscription, you will need to sign out, and then sign in with the other email address.
- If your company buys subscriptions through a Volume License, your admin may not have assigned a subscription to you.  

### Renewing my subscriptions
**Standard subscriptions**
- Microsoft Store: If you purchased your subscription from the [Microsoft Store](http://www.microsoft.com/store), you can renew it there as well. 
- Volume License:  If your company buys subscriptions through a Volume License, your admin should contact a reseller to renew your subscriptions.

**Cloud subscriptions -** Cloud subscriptions don't need to be renewed.  As long as your subscription is paid, it will remain active. 

**Subscriptions acquired through programs -** If you get your subscription through a program, your subscription is tied to your participation in the program.  Please reach out to your program contacts for additional information.

### Transferring subscriptions
If your subscription was purchased through Microsoft Volume Licensing and you need to re-assign it to someone else within the organization, your administrator will need to do this for you. 
Retail subscriptions can be transferred to another user by contacting Customer Service.  Complimentary or “Not For Resale” subscriptions cannot be transferred.

### Linking my subscription to existing VSTS or Azure subscriptions
If you sign in to your subscription using a personal Microsoft account (MSA) and have a subscription that includes Visual Studio Team Services or Microsoft Azure using a work or school account managed by Azure, you can link the two subscriptions. This is called an "alternate account" and allows you to keep using your MSA to sign in to your subscription while having access to existing Azure, VSTS or IDE resources that are associated with your school or work accounts. 

Even if both accounts use the same email address, you need to add your work/school account as an alternate to use your benefits across both accounts. 

To add an alternate account:
1. Sign in to the [Subscriber Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com) with your Microsoft Account (MSA).
2. Click on the **Subscriptions** tab.
3. Under **Related Links**, choose **Add alternate account**.
4. Enter your work/school account emaiil address and click **Add**. 

![Alternate Account](_img\manage-vs-subscriptions\alternate-account-resized.png)

Once you have added an alternate account, you can update or remove it at any time by clicking the **Subscriptions** tab and choosing the appropriate option in the **Related Links** section.
