    a. **Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2015.**
    
         i. For each license of Visual Studio Enterprise, Visual Studio Professional, or Visual Studio Test Professional with MSDN that you acquire, you are entitled to one server license for Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2015 and one Team Foundation Server User CAL. The CAL is reserved solely for use by the subscriber (the licensed user).

        ii. The Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2015 software includes SQL Server 2014 Standard Edition. Your use of such SQL Server Standard Edition is subject to the license terms for that edition along with these modified use terms below: 

       You may run, at any one time, only one instance of SQL Server 2014 Standard Edition in one physical or virtual operating system environment on one server solely to support the software. You do not need SQL Server CALs for this use.


   b.  **Utilities.** The software contains some items on the Utilities List at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523763&clcid=0x409.](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523763&clcid=0x409)  You may copy and install those items on your or other third party machines. Please note that Utilities are designed for temporary use, that Microsoft may not be able to patch or update Utilities separately from the rest of the software, and that some Utilities by their nature may make it possible for others to access machines on which they are installed. As a result, you should delete all Utilities you have installed after you finish debugging or deploying your applications and databases. Microsoft is not responsible for any third party use or access of Utilities you install on any machine.

   c. **Build Server.** The software contains some items on the Build Server List at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523763&clcid=0x409.](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523763&clcid=0x409)  You may copy and install those items, if included in the software, onto your build machines. You and others in your organization may use these items on your build machines solely for the purpose of compiling, building, verifying and archiving your applications or running quality or performance tests as part of the build process.

   d. **Scope of License.** You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software except, and solely to the extent: (i) permitted by applicable law, despite this limitation; or (ii) required to debug changes to any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License which are included with and linked to by the software.

   e. **Developer Resources.** The software includes compilers, languages, runtimes, environments, and other resources. These components may be governed by separate agreements and have their own product support policies.

   g. **Package Managers.** The software includes package managers, like NuGet, that give you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages to use with the software or you’re application. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.

5.  **ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS FOR WINDOW SERVER REMOTE DESKTOP SERVICES**

    a. **Remote Desktop Services.** Up to 200 anonymous users at a time may use the Remote Desktop Services feature of the Windows Server software to access online demonstrations of your applications.

    b. **Windows Home Server Remote Access Features.** You are responsible for making sure that your use of Windows Home Server’s remote access features complies with your broadband providers’ terms of service. You may need to add services from your broadband provider to use Windows Home Server’s remote access features. For example, you will need certain “ports” to be open to use these features, and some broadband providers block those ports for customers on some service plans. Also, some broadband providers’ terms of service may limit or prohibit setting up and running of “servers” on their networks by some customers on some service plans. Please contact your broadband provider if you have questions about their terms of service.

6.  **ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS FOR OFFICE PROFESSIONAL PLUS 2013** 

    a. Office Professional Plus 2013. For each license of Visual Studio Enterprise that you acquire, the licensed user may also install and use one copy of Office Pro Plus 2013 on one device for production use. These rights are in addition to the rights that come with the desktop program that is governed by the Office Professional Plus 2013 agreement you accept when installing the Office Profession Plus software.

7.  **MULTIPLEXING.** Hardware or software you use to 
    - pool connections,
    - reroute information,
    - reduce the number of devices or users that directly access or use the software,
    - reduce the number of devices or users the software directly manages, 

    (sometimes referred to as “multiplexing” or “pooling”), does not reduce the number of licenses of any type that you need.


8. **MANDATORY ACTIVATION.** Activation associates the use of the software with a specific device. During activation, the software will send information about the software and the device to Microsoft. This information includes the version, language and product key of the software, the Internet protocol address of the device, and information derived from the hardware configuration of the device. For more information, see [microsoft.com/piracy/activation.mspx.[(http://microsoft.com/piracy/activation.mspx)] By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information. Before you activate, you have the right to use the version of the software installed during the installation process. **Your right to use the software after the time specified in the installation process is limited unless it is activated.** This is to prevent its unlicensed use. You will not be able to continue using the software after that time if you do not activate it. If the device is connected to the Internet, the software may automatically connect to Microsoft for activation. You can also activate the software manually by Internet or telephone. If you do so, Internet and telephone service charges may apply. Some changes to your computer components or the software may require you to reactivate the software. **The software will remind you to activate it until you do.**

9. **VALIDATION.**

     a. Validation verifies that the software has been activated and is properly licensed. It also verifies that no unauthorized changes have been made to the validation, licensing, or activation functions of the software. Validation may also check for certain malicious or unauthorized software related to such unauthorized changes. A validation check confirming that you are properly licensed permits you to continue to use the software, certain features of the software or to obtain additional benefits. **You are not permitted to circumvent validation.** This is to prevent unlicensed use of the software. For more information, see [go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104610](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104610).

    b. The software will from time to time perform a validation check of the software. The check may be initiated by the software or Microsoft. To enable the activation function and validation checks, the software may from time to time require updates or additional downloads of the validation, licensing or activation functions of the software. The updates or downloads are required for the proper functioning of the software and may be downloaded and installed without further notice to you. During or after a validation check, the software may send information about the software, the computer and the results of the validation check to Microsoft. This information includes, for example, the version and product key of the software, any unauthorized changes made to the validation, licensing or activation functions of the software, any related malicious or unauthorized software found and the Internet protocol address of the computer. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information. For more information about validation and what is sent during or after a validation check, see [go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104611](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104611).

    c. If, after a validation check, the software is found to be counterfeit, improperly licensed, a non-genuine Windows product, or include unauthorized changes, the functionality and experience of using the software will be affected, for example: 

    Microsoft may

    - repair the software, remove, quarantine or disable any unauthorized changes that may interfere with the proper use of the software, including circumvention of the activation or validation functions of the software, or
    - check and remove malicious or unauthorized software known to be related to such unauthorized changes, or
    - provide notices that the software is improperly licensed or a non-genuine Windows product
    - and you may 
        - receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software, or
        - need to follow Microsoft’s instructions to be licensed to use the software and reactivate,

    - and you may not be able to 
        - use or continue to use the software or some of the features of the software, or
        - obtain certain updates or upgrades from Microsoft


    d. You may only obtain updates or upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized sources. For more information on obtaining updates from authorized sources see [go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104612](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104612).

10. **ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS FOR WINDOWS 10.** Additional Microsoft and third party terms may apply to your use of certain features, services and apps, depending on your device’s capabilities, how it is configured, and how you use it. Please be sure to read them. 

    a. **Windows Apps.** Some Windows apps provide an access point to, or rely on, online services, and the use of those services is sometimes governed by separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Microsoft Services Agreement at ([aka.ms/msa](http://aka.ms/msa)). You can view these terms and policies by looking at the service terms of use or the app’s settings, as applicable. The services may not be available in all regions.

    b. **Malware protection.** Microsoft cares about protecting your device from malware. The software will turn on malware protection if other protection is not installed or has expired. To do so, other antimalware software will be disabled or may have to be removed.

    c. **Adobe Flash Player.** The software includes Adobe Flash Player that is licensed under terms from Adobe Systems Incorporated, at [(aka.ms/adobeflash)](http://aka.ms/adobeflash).

        - indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on the Distributable Code.

    c. **Distribution Restrictions.** You may not: 
        - use Microsoft’s trademarks in your applications’ names or in a way that suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
        - modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License.

16. **DOCUMENTATION.** Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.
17. **RENEWAL.** If this subscription is marked as a renewal version, you may use it only if you have a license to use the subscription eligible for renewal. If you renew, this software takes the place of the earlier version, and this agreement takes the place of the agreement for that earlier version.

repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or
Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.

    Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

<div style="text-align:center"><span>LIMITED WARRANTY</span></div>

A. **LIMITED WARRANTY.** If you follow the instructions, the software will perform substantially as described in the Microsoft materials that you receive in or with the software.

</span></div> 

  

**Visual Studio 2015 Products:** 

**DATA.** The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation. There are also some features in the software that may enable you to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and the privacy statement at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528096&clcid=0x409](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528096&clcid=0x409). Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

  

**Windows 10**

**Privacy; Consent to Use of Data.** Your privacy is important to us. Some of the software features send or receive information when using those features. Many of these features can be switched off in the user interface, or you can choose not to use them. By accepting this agreement and using the software you agree that Microsoft may collect, use, and disclose the information as described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement ([aka.ms/privacy](http://aka.ms/privacy)), and as may be described in the user interface associated with the software features.
  

**Windows Server 2012 R2** 
1. **INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.** Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time. 

    a. **Consent for Internet-Based Services.** The software features described below and in the Windows Server Privacy Highlights connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. You may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, go to [go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=280262](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=280262). **By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information.** Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you. 

    Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you run the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.

    - Windows Update Feature. You may connect new hardware to the device where you run the software. Your device may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, the update feature of the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and run it on your device. You can switch off this update feature.
    - Web Content Features. Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you. To provide the content, these features send to Microsoft the type of operating system, name and version of the software you are using, type of browser and language code of the device where you run the software. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content features.
    - Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and macros, to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists. These security features operate only when you use the Internet.
    - Auto Root Update. The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate authorities. You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.
    - Windows Media Digital Rights Management. Content owners use Windows Media digital rights management technology (WMDRM) to protect their intellectual property, including copyrights. This software and third party software use WMDRM to play and copy WMDRM-protected content. If the software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask Microsoft to revoke the software’s ability to use WMDRM to play or copy protected content. Revocation does not affect other content. When you download licenses for protected content, you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses. Content owners may require you to upgrade WMDRM to access their content. Microsoft software that includes WMDRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade. You may switch off WMDRM features that access the Internet. When these features are off, you can still play content for which you have a valid license.
    - Windows Media Player. When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for
        - compatible online music services in your region;
        - new versions of the player; and
        - codecs if your device does not have the correct ones for playing content. 

            You can switch off this last feature. For more information, go to www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/12/privacy.aspx.


    - Malicious Software Removal. During setup, if you select “Get important updates for installation”, the software may check and remove certain malware from your device. “Malware” is malicious software. If the software runs, it will remove the Malware listed and updated at [www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830](http://www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830). During a Malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific information about Malware detected, errors, and other information about your device. This information is used to improve the software and other Microsoft products and services. No information included in these reports will be used to identify or contact you. You may disable the software’s reporting functionality by following the instructions found at [www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830](http://www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830). For more information, read the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool privacy statement at [go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113995](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113995).
    - Network Awareness. This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query only transfers standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can switch off the active query feature through a registry setting.
    - Windows Time Service. This service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week to provide your computer with the correct time. You can turn this feature off or choose your preferred time source within the Date and Time Control Panel applet. The connection uses standard NTP protocol.
    - IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo). This feature helps existing home Internet gateway devices transition to IPv6. IPv6 is a next generation Internet protocol. It helps enable end-to-end connectivity often needed by peer-to-peer applications. To do so, each time you start up the software the Teredo client service will attempt to locate a public Teredo Internet service. It does so by sending a query over the Internet. This query only transfers standard Domain Name Service information to determine if your computer is connected to the Internet and can locate a public Teredo service. If you 
        - use an application that needs IPv6 connectivity or
        - configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity
by default standard Internet Protocol information will be sent to the Teredo service at Microsoft at regular intervals. No other information is sent to Microsoft. You can change this default to use non-Microsoft servers. You can also switch off this feature using a command line utility named “netsh”.

    - Windows Server 2012 Active Directory Rights Management Services. The software contains a feature that allows you to create content that cannot be printed, copied or sent to others without your permission. For more information, go to [www.microsoft.com/rms](https://www.microsoft.com/rms). You may choose not to use this feature.
    - Accelerators. When you use click on or move your mouse over an Accelerator, the title and full web address or URL of the current webpage, as well as standard computer information, and any content you have selected, might be sent to the service provider. If you use an Accelerator provided by Microsoft, the information sent is subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement, which is available at [go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493). If you use an Accelerator provided by a third party, use of the information sent will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices.

    b. **Use of Information.** Microsoft may use the computer information, Accelerator information, and Malware reports to improve our software and services. We may also share it with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.

    c. **Misuse of Internet-based Services.** You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.

**INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.** Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.

  

**Office 2013 Desktop Application Software** 

**INTERNET-BASED FEATURES.** The following software features use Internet protocols, which send to Microsoft (or its suppliers or service providers) computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the computer where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based features available to you, in accordance with the Office 2013 Privacy Statement, at [r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidOOPrivacyState15HighLight?clid=1033](http://r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidOOPrivacyState15HighLight?clid=1033). Some Internet-based features may be delivered at a later date via Microsoft’s Update service.
1. _Consent for Internet-Based Services._ The software features described below and in the Office 2013 Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see the Office 2013 Privacy Statement at [r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidOOPrivacyState15HighLight?clid=1033](http://r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidOOPrivacyState15HighLight?clid=1033). **BY USING THESE FEATURES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION.** Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.
2. _Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP)._ This software uses CEIP. CEIP automatically sends Microsoft information about your hardware and how you use this software. We do not use this information to identify or contact you. CEIP will also periodically download a small file to your computer.

To learn more about CEIP, see [microsoft.com/products/ceip/EN-US/privacypolicy.mspx](http://microsoft.com/products/ceip/EN-US/privacypolicy.mspx).
3. _Online Features and Content._ Features in the software can retrieve online content from Microsoft and provide it to you. Certain features may also permit you to search for and access information online. Examples of these features include clip art, templates, online training, online assistance and help, and Outlook Weather on the Calendar. If you save a template provided by [Office.com](http://office.com/), information will be sent online to Microsoft, such as information that identifies the template, but not any specific document you have created using the template. This information is used to provide you with content you request and to improve our services. You may choose not to use these online features and content. See the Office 2013 Privacy Statement linked at the end of this agreement for more information.
4. _Cookies._ If you choose to use online features in the software, such as online assistance and help, and templates, cookies may be set. To learn how to block, control and delete cookies, please read the cookies section of the Office 2013 Privacy Statement linked at the end of this agreement.
5. _Office 2013 on Windows 8._ If you are running the software on a Windows 8 computer and you have enabled the software’s online features and content, signing into Windows 8 with a Microsoft account will automatically sign you into the software using the same Microsoft account. This allows you to store and access online files in your personal cloud storage service with Microsoft (formerly SkyDrive) and enjoy the Office Roaming Service without being asked to reenter your Microsoft account username and password. For more information about signing into the software with a Microsoft account and the Office Roaming Service, see the Office 2013 Privacy Statement linked at the end of this agreement.
6. _Digital Certificates._ The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information.
