# Handling ‘over-claimed’ subscriptions
Sometimes orders are changed after subscribers have been added, which can result in having more assigned subscriptions than licenses owned by your company. When this happens, the Subscribers tab will show an alert and provide you with further information. 
**Note: Overclaimed scenarios will not be allowed in Open License programs.**

1.	To resolve over-claimed licenses, click the alert text. This will display a filtered list of the subscribers that are assigned to the subscription level and expiration date that is over-claimed. 
2.	Remove subscribers as needed to rectify the over-claimed licenses.

3.	The overview on the left side of the page will update to show that you are once again in compliance, and all over-claimed notifications will disappear.
