# Accessing the Visual Studio subsubscriptions Administrator Portal
## For MPSA
To access the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal, you will need to be set up as an administrator in the Microsoft Business Center Portal or the BCP. 

If you need information about how to be set up as an administrator, please refer to the [Manage User Quick Start Guide](https://mvlc.blob.core.windows.net/en-us/MVLC_QS_Manage_Users.pdf). 
If you have already been set up as an administrator, then you can go directly to the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com)

## For Volume Licensing (VL)
As of March 1st, 2017, customers who are still working through the portal onboarding and migration process will need to manage their subscriptions in the [Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx). 

For more information about managing subscriptions in the VLSC check out these guides:
- [Understanding Visual Studio Subscriptions for VLSC](https://www.visualstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Understanding-Visual-Studio-Subscriptions-Administration-Guide-for-VLSC.pdf)  
- [Managing Visual Studio Subscriptions for VLSC](https://www.visualstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Managing-Visual-Studio-Subscriptions-Administration-Guide-for-VLSC.pdf). 

Your Primary or Notices Contact for your organizationâ€™s Volume Licensing contract will need to take a few steps to set you up as an administrator. 

If you need information about how to set up an administrator, please watch [this video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Studio-Subscriptions-Administration/Onboarding-your-organization-to-the-new-Visual-Studio-Subscription-Administration-Portal-and-setting) and refer to these articles on [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal onboarding and managing administrators](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839391).
