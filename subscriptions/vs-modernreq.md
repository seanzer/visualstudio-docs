# Activating the MODERNRequirements Benefit in Visual Studio Subscriptions
Your Enterprise subscription includes a six month subscription for MODERNRequirements SmartOffice 4TFS and ModernRequirements4TFS.  MODERNRequirements’ SmartOffice4TFS extends the capabilities of TFS or Visual Studio Team Services with Microsoft Word-based reporting, and quick, simplified rich text authoring.  ModernRequirements4TFS provides work item baselining and HTML5 simulation capabilities.
